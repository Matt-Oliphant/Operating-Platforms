# Operating-Platforms

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a successful gaming company that had a hit game, Draw It or Lose It, designed for the Android environment. However, they wanted to outsource the development of thier web-based presence to our consultant firm. The Gaming Room wanted us to adapt the game to a web-environment in order to be able to connect to any client that uses any of the most popular operating system: Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. 

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I created an accurate UML Diagram to depict the architecture of the Draw It or Lose It application. I referenced this diagram to update the application as needed and also was able to focus design elements around the diagram. When I was confused how a method was supposed to function, I could look at the UML and quickly determine where any issues were arising from.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found focusing on the summary of what is needed and the design constraints of producing it helped when developing code. Having a detailed understanding of what is expected out of the final product helps focus the development process and eliminates confusion that could otherwise lead to bottlenecks. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part of these documents to revise I think it would be the evaluation section of the design template. It's not that I'm aware of any falsities within it, but I think more exposure to system's architecture would help me consider aspects that I cannot currently. Further, this section covers a lot of ground that would take a long time to master, so experience with additional operating platforms would allow me to better evaluate the development requirements.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted that the user's needs included the need to understand how their application could be expanded to other environments. I further understood that their application would render an image over the course of thirty seconds and the user would have to try and guess what the image depicted. I implemented this into software design by choosing the client-server architecture and by having the images loaded to the client before the game starts. It's important to consider user's needs when designing in order to prioritize requirements in a secure manner because we want the user to be happy the final product and be free from attacks.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I took a holistic approach to design software that focused on utilizing tools in order to plan which design patters were appropriate for this application. The UML Diagram as stated above was very useful to reference when designing and I would use UML diagrams again in the future to analyze and design software applications.
